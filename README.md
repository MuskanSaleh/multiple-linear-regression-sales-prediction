# Multiple Linear Regression - Sales Prediction

This project involves building a multiple linear regression model to predict sales based on TV and radio promotional budgets. The analysis is performed using Python, and key statistical tests are applied to evaluate the model's performance.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to estimate the impact of different advertising channels on sales, particularly focusing on TV and radio promotional budgets. The project includes the following steps:
- Data exploration and visualization
- Building a multiple linear regression model
- Statistical testing and validation of the model
- Reporting key findings and recommendations

## Key Findings
- **TV Promotions**: High TV promotional budgets significantly boost sales. A low TV budget predicts $154.297 million lower sales compared to a high TV promotion, holding radio constant.
- **Radio Promotions**: A $1 million increase in radio promotional budget results in a $2.97 million increase in sales.
- **Statistical Significance**: All model coefficients are statistically significant with p-values of 0.000 at a 95% confidence level.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data processing and analysis
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For visualizations
- **Scikit-learn**: For building the regression model
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive code and analysis
